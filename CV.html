        <h2>Who am I?</h2>     <!-- Personal Info Section -->
            <p>
                I am a 25-year old Civil Engineer who was always passionate about computers and programming since early teenage. It was really fun and interesting to develop my first ever program using Visual Basic. As years passed, I went far away from programming even though I was fed with the support of some of my friends who told me that I had great potential in the field. My decision was later influenced by my parents' vision, which led me to join the Civil Engineering program. Unfortunately, I noticed that I didn't like the field, but it was too late for me to drop and start from the beginning. I then realized that my first dream was put on hold, so I searched for bootcamps that can help me recover my dream in becoming a programmer. SE factory was exactly what I wanted, a program that grants me the required knowledge and skills to become a Software Engineer without requiring unnecessary courses just as in the university. At SE factory, I want to fulfill my interest, enhance my skills, and work on my weak spots. I am looking forward to continue my journey at SE factory and graduate as a Software Engineer to have my dream job.
